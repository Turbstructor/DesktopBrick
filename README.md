A Set of Rainmeter Skins, majorly about Hardware Status read from HWiNFO.

Required: Download and install HWiNFO(and its Rainmeter Plugin. I didn't add it now, but will do it ASAP)

I'm just playing with how to use HWiNFO and Rainmeter together.
These files are far from complete, but it might be good to share what I have done so far.
It's OK to clone my files.

- Modifications needed:
    - Rename skins and this repo(Doesn't look right)
    - Optimize(or shorten) skin codes
    - Remove unnecessary files
    - Implement DiskStatus skin(currently DiskUsage)
    - Enrich README.md
